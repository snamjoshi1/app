The signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction. Traffic congestion is a severe problem in many major cities across the world and it has become a major issue for the commuters in these cities. Conventional traffic light system is based on fixed time concept allotted to each side of the junction which cannot be varied as per varying traffic density. Junction timings allotted are fixed. Sometimes higher traffic density at one side of the junction demands longer green time as compared to standard allotted time. The image captured in the traffic signal is processed and converted into grayscale image in order to calculate the number of vehicles present in the image. After calculating the number of vehicles, we will come to know in which side the density is high based on which signals will be allotted for a side. Green signal will be increased by the controller instruction. Raspberry pi is used as a microcontroller which provides the signal timing based on the traffic density.
